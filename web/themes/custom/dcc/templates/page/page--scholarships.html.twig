            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
              <p>The Disability Care Center is proud to offer scholarship opportunities that can help further the
                education of American college students who are either disabled or seeking a degree in special education.
                All applicants who apply for one of our scholarship programs must satisfy our set of requirements to
                ensure they are full-time students in pursuit of a college degree. To be eligible for any of our
                scholarship programs, an applicant must meet the following requirements: &nbsp; <span
                  class="numberCircle2">1</span> &nbsp;</p>
              <h4>The applicant must be enrolled in a U.S. college institution.</h4>
              <p>&nbsp; <span class="numberCircle2">2</span> &nbsp;</p>
              <h4>The applicant must be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours of classes for the upcoming fall
                semester.</h4>
              <p>&nbsp; <span class="numberCircle2">3</span> &nbsp;</p>
              <h4>The applicant must have a GPA of at least 2.5&nbsp;from their most recent transcript (college or high
                school).</h4>
              <p>&nbsp; <span class="numberCircle2">4</span> &nbsp;</p>
              <h4>The applicant must have one letter of recommendation from a creditable source.</h4>
              <p>&nbsp; <span class="numberCircle2">5</span> &nbsp;</p>
              <h4>The applicant must be a legal resident of the United States.</h4>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Accreditation &amp; Documentation</span></h2>
              <p>All of the requirements above must be validated with the proper documentation. The applicant will need
                to
                submit the documentation as part of the application for the scholarship. Essentially we will need a copy
                of the applicant’s:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>College acceptance letter or college ID</li>
                <li>Upcoming fall class schedule (confirming 12 credit hours or more)</li>
                <li>Most recent transcript (college or high school)</li>
                <li>Valid ID or documentation confirming legal residency (driver’s license, passport, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Short Essay &amp; Selection Process</span></h2>
              <p>All scholarships we offer require an applicant to write a short essay between 500 and 1,500 words.
                Essay
                topics vary depending on the scholarship and are judged by our team of senior disability advocates based
                on originality, writing style, quality of content, and degree of research (if applicable). The essay
                portion is the bulk of the application and is used to determine the winner of a scholarship. All
                applications should be submitted via email no later than the application deadline. Once the application
                period has closed our judges will read all of the essays and choose winners by the third week of August.
                Winners will be published on the scholarship page and promoted on our social media accounts. The winners
                will receive a one-time award paid directly to the institution they are currently attending. The award
                must used to finance educational expenses such as tuition, fees, books, housing, travel costs, meal
                plans,
                etc. &nbsp;</p>
